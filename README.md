# new-business-loc-BCN

Where in Barcelona is my new business going to be most sucessful? 

I use  ML algorithms to find the best location for a new business.

Data is stored in a mySQL database, using the following tables:
- restaurant
- neighborhood
- district
- censal_section

Data is retrieved from the following sources:
- Google maps Places API.
  * Nearby search: place_id, name, rating, user_rating_total, price_level, vicinity, geometry, business_status
- Barcelona open data (city council). The complete catalog of dataset can be consulted at https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset
